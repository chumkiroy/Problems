Problem Statement:  Implement Merge Sort

Please convert the standard merge-sort algorithm into code.

Input: Integers in an array, duplicates possible

Output: Same integers in ascending order, in a new array. Preserve the input array.

(Goal of this homework problem: The concept of partitioning, concept of merging partitions, the clarity that merge-sort needs extra space and why worst-case is better than QuickSort viz. O(NLogN))

Question:
In the solution above, what is the Complexity of memory requirement? Can we do better than that?
