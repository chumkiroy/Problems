Problem statement:

A Tower of Hanoi is a game, that consists of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The game starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time. 
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack. 
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Input: Number of disks in the first rod. e.g if the number is 5, you can assume that disks are arranged with 1 on top of 2, 2 on top of 3 and so on, until 4 on top of 5, with 5 at the bottom. 

Output: Series of steps which leads to all disks landing on the third rod. Each step can be represented by printing the number of disks on each rod after the step is taken. 

There are no test-cases set, because of the fluid nature of the output. Feel free to hard code the input and display the output on STDOUT.
