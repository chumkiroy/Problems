Problem Statement: Print a string Sinusoidally

[This is just a stupid problem, that has no relation to anything else. It's there primarily because we see it on and off. It's a string puzzle disguised as a programming problem]

Also called "SnakeString". For example, the phrase "Google Worked" should be printed as follows (where ~ is the word separator):

    o     ~       k
  o  g  e  W  r   e
G     l      o      d
