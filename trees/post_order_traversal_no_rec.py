PROBLEM STATEMENT: PostOrder traversal

Write a function to traverse a Binary tree PostOrder, without using recursion. As you traverse, please print contents of the nodes.

Custom Input Format:
---------------------
First line contains single integer denoting total no of nodes in the tree.

Seconds line contains pre-order traversal of tree (values are space separated).

For example:
------------
3
1 # #

Denotes tree like:
    1
  /   \
 null null
--------------------------------------

7
1 2 3 # # # #

Denotes tree like:
       1
      /   \
     2    null
    /  \
   3   null
  /  \
 null  null

Use the option "Show Input/Output Code " just above the code editor, to see, how input is read, tree is built, the function that you are going to complete is called and output is printed.
