PROBLEM STATEMENT: Largest BST

Given a binary tree, find the largest Binary Search Tree (BST), where largest means BST with largest number of nodes in it. The largest BST must include all of its descendants.

Custom Input Format:
--------------------
First line contains single integer denoting total no of nodes in the tree.

Seconds line contains pre-order traversal of tree (values are space separated).

For example:
------------
3
1 # #

Denotes tree like:
    1
  /   \
 null null

--------------------------------------

7
1 2 3 # # # #

Denotes tree like:
       1
      /   \
     2    null
    /  \
   3   null
  /  \
 null  null

Use the option "Show Input/Output Code " just above the code editor, to see, how input is read, tree is built, the function that you are going to complete is called and output is printed.

Notes:
------
Suggested time: 30 minutes.
