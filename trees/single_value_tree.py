PROBLEM STATEMENT: Single Value Tree

Given a binary tree, we need to count the number of unival subtrees (all nodes that have the same value). 
e.g. Given the following tree, it has 6 unival subtrees.

Custom Input Format:
First line contains single integer denoting total no of nodes in the tree.
Seconds line contains pre-order traversal of tree (values are space separated).

For example:
3
1 # #

Denotes tree like:
    1
  /   \
 null null
--------------------------------------

7
1 2 3 # # # #

Denotes tree like:
       1
      /   \
     2    null
    /  \
   3   null
  /  \
 null  null

Use the option "Show Input/Output Code " just above the code editor, to see, how input is read, tree is built, the function that you are going to complete is called and output is printed.
